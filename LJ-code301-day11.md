# Learning Journal Day 10

Today we focused on using page.js to generate paths/routes for our single page application. The general idea is that we have the template for each "page" in the app hidden on the page. We then only load the data when a call for it is made. Sometimes that data can be overwritten. But we should save the calls in the history, so if the user hits the back button, they get their old call. This is what page.js helps with.

I also spent some time adding functional programming methods to my code. This included .map instead of .each or .foreach and .reduce, to reduce an array into a single value. Although we can use .reduce to reduce an array into just fewer values.

It was a productive day, and now I'm trying to get ahead on the readings.

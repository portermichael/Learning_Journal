# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

Today was very productive. Nicu, Devin and I spent a significant amount of plan detailing the plan for our 301 project. We wrote out a solid model, wire frame and stretch goals plan. The model focused on functions and how we would use them to communicate and handle data. The wire frame is a diagram of our app on both phone and larger screens. The stretch goals represent the goals we can reach after our MVP. We ranked them in terms of preference, and want to start with a free play, a top score record and lastly a share/multiplayer.

In class we went over middleware. It was relieving that we had discussed the middle ware in great detail during our commenting phase. It was a bit time consuming, and we finished after most other groups, but we could then see that most groups didn't go into this detail performing a stack trace.

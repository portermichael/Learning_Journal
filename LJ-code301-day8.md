# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

We set up a node server and have been going over the server.js the last two days. Today was mostly focused on the CRUD of our server queries and what we are calling to get them to do their business. The reading on SQL queries was very interesting. I had done some in the past, but it was hidden behind a framework. I'm glad I got the opportunity to learn how to do the specific searches and practice with them a bit. I have the concept of databases down pretty well, but it was nice to set up a fresh node.js server.

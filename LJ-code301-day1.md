# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Today we went over the course work and had a mini orientation. We touched on markdown and the usage of codepen.io.

We went over the concepts of MVC as well as the merits of responsive web design. The principal of MVC is to add some logic to the way we perceive our app. It works for both phone and web apps. The user sees the view, and interacts/fills in forms which gets sent to the controller. The controller responds to requests by checking with the model/database and sending back/modifying the view. We imagine the view as HTML/CSS and some JS. The controller is our language or logic and the model is our database.

The principals of RWD are to have a view that is flexible for many devices. We can include media breakpoints with @media screen and (min-width: 640px) { //content goes in here! }.

# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Today, the biggest difference was logically talking through and understanding our code. My partner and I didn't do a lot of writing until we understood what we were trying to do. I think it significantly sped up our workload because we weren't writing bad/incorrect code and trying to correct it with stabs in the dark. It will be something I'll try and continue towards my future pair work and independent project work. Even talking it aloud helped my efficiency.

In a group we used jQuery to modify html, attributes and other characteristics of the DOM by selecting CSS elements. It was most important for us to make sure we had a good idea of what we were targeting, then writing the code doing the targeting.

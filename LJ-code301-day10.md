# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

Today was spent on functional programming. I think I need to read more about it. I thought I had a good understanding of it, but it seems we weren't as quick as I wanted to be. I probably couldn't have done it all on my own, and I would like have that ability. I also couldn't answer all the questions on my own. I think in order to act quickly and solve the problems I should be able to do that.

I definitely need to dedicate this weekend to studying and preparation, so I can be a faster coder.
